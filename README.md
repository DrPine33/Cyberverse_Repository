# Cyberverse_Repository
 This games purpose is to teach you cyberterms. The core gameplay loop is talking to the NPC's located around the map. Once you finish talking to an NPC the quest marker above them will dissapear and you will gain a point. After talking to all of the NPC's the level will end and the level completion screen will show you the terms you should of have ran into.  

 Below I will put a link to my main scripts:
